"""Determine GitHub Actions outputs for the weekly dependency update workflow.

Inspects the working-tree diff of ``py/pyproject.toml`` and ``py/uv.lock`` to
decide whether anything changed and, if so, whether any provider SDK pins
shifted (which requires cassette re-recording).

Writes ``key=value`` lines to stdout in the format expected by
``$GITHUB_OUTPUT``:

    changed=true|false
    needs_rerecord=true|false   # only when changed=true

Run from ``py/`` (same working directory as the workflow step):

    python scripts/determine-dependency-update-labels.py >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
