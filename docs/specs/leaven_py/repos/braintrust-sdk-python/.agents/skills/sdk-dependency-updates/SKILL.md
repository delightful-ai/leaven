# SDK Dependency Updates

Use this skill for dependency bump PRs in this repo, especially the weekly automation from `.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml`.

Keep the work narrow. These PRs should usually stay limited to:

- `py/pyproject.toml`
- `py/uv.lock`
- affected `latest` cassette files when a re-record is justified

If the task becomes mainly about VCR mechanics, use `sdk-vcr-workflows`.
If the entry point is a failing GitHub Actions job, use `sdk-ci-triage`.
If the bump exposes an SDK or integration bug that needs code changes, use `sdk-integrations`.

## Read First

Always read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml`
- `.github/workflows/checks.yaml`
- `py/pyproject.toml`
  Focus on `[tool.braintrust.matrix]` and `[tool.braintrust.cassette-dirs]`.
- `py/noxfile.py`
- `py/scripts/update-matrix-latest.py`
- `py/scripts/determine-dependency-update-labels.py`
- `py/src/braintrust/conftest.py`
- `py/src/braintrust/integrations/conftest.py`

Read when relevant:

- `py/src/braintrust/integrations/versioning.py` for version-gated behavior
- PR metadata from `gh pr view <pr>`
- changed integration tests and cassette directories for affected providers
- [references/session-mapping.md](./references/session-mapping.md) for matrix-key classification, non-obvious session/cassette mappings, shared-directory constraints, and recording gotchas

## Core Rules

- Work from `py/` for SDK commands.
- Use `mise` as the source of truth for tools and Python versions.
- Check out the actual PR branch with `gh pr checkout <pr-number>`. Do not work from a synthetic `pr-<n>` branch created via `git fetch origin pull/<n>/head:...`; it has no upstream and blocks pushing refreshed cassettes back to the PR.
- Do not guess session names; read `py/noxfile.py`.
- Do not trust the PR label blindly; verify the actual diff in `py/pyproject.toml` and `py/uv.lock`.
- Re-record only affected `latest` cassettes. Do not churn older version directories unless older pins changed or the user asked.
- Review the cassette diff itself, not just pass/fail status.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect the PR and check out the real branch

Start with metadata and changed files, then switch to the PR branch with upstream tracking:

```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --repo braintrustdata/braintrust-sdk-python \
  --json title,body,labels,files,headRefName,baseRefName
gh pr checks <pr-number> --repo braintrustdata/braintrust-sdk-python
gh pr checkout <pr-number>
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- py/pyproject.toml py/uv.lock
```

Confirm:

- the PR is the dependency-update workflow output
- the branch tracks `origin/<headRefName>`
- the diff is still narrowly scoped
- the label matches the actual dependency change

### 2. Reproduce the workflow's classification locally

From `py/`, run the same script the workflow uses:

```bash
cd py
python scripts/determine-dependency-update-labels.py
```

Treat the script as the source of truth for workflow labels. Treat your manual diff review as the source of truth for what work to do next.

### 3. Classify the changed keys

Classify each changed matrix key before recording anything:

- infra-only keys: no cassette refresh work
- keys with versioned integration cassettes: usually targeted `latest` playback or re-record work
- keys without versioned integration cassettes: targeted validation only

Use [references/session-mapping.md](./references/session-mapping.md) for the current classification and mappings.

### 4. Apply the bump-severity policy

Default policy:

- patch bump: skip re-recording and rely on targeted playback
- minor bump: re-record affected `latest` cassettes
- major bump: re-record and expect follow-on SDK or integration work

For `0.y.z` packages, treat the middle segment as the minor version:

- `0.14.3 -> 0.14.4` is a patch bump
- `0.14.3 -> 0.15.0` is a minor bump
- `0.x -> 1.x` is a major bump

Override the default and re-record a patch bump when:

- the user explicitly asks
- existing `latest` playback fails against the new pin
- release notes call out wire-format or response-shape changes
- the integration is known-fragile and has recent cassette drift

### 5. Decide the minimum validation scope

Default to the smallest scope that matches the diff:

- one changed provider package: validate or refresh only that provider
- several changed providers: handle each provider independently
- shared cassette directory: group those sessions together and record serially

When several matrix keys share a directory, delete and refresh that directory once, then run every affected session that writes to it.

### 6. Re-record only when justified

For cassette refresh work, delete the affected `latest` directory first so stale responses are not silently reused:

```bash
cd py
rm -rf src/braintrust/integrations/<provider>/cassettes/latest
```

Before recording, neutralize local Braintrust env vars so provider cassettes do not capture unrelated Braintrust traffic:

```bash
unset BRAINTRUST_API_URL
unset BRAINTRUST_APP_URL
unset BRAINTRUST_ORG_NAME
export BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=___TEST_API_KEY__
```

Use the exact nox session from `py/noxfile.py`. Prefer nox over raw pytest so `BRAINTRUST_TEST_PACKAGE_VERSION=latest` is set correctly.

Examples:

```bash
cd py
nox -s "test_openai_agents(latest)" -- --vcr-record=all
nox -s "test_litellm(latest)" -- --vcr-record=all
nox -s "test_langchain(latest)" -- --vcr-record=all
```

For Claude Agent SDK transport recordings:

```bash
cd py
BRAINTRUST_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_RECORD_MODE=all nox -s "test_claude_agent_sdk(latest)"
```

Provider API keys are expected to exist in this local environment. If a session fails fast with an auth error, stop and ask the user instead of fabricating cassettes.

### 7. Review diffs and scan for pollution

Be suspicious of:

- Braintrust API traffic inside provider cassettes
- missing interactions after a delete-and-record pass
- brand-new endpoint families unrelated to the provider under test
- large request-shape changes that do not match the dependency bump

Quick scan:

```bash
rg -n "staging-api\.braintrust\.dev|api\.braintrust\.dev/version|/logs3|braintrust\.dev/version" \
  py/src/braintrust/integrations/*/cassettes/latest
```

If recording appears to succeed but produces no real cassette updates, read [references/session-mapping.md](./references/session-mapping.md) for provider-specific cache gotchas.

### 8. Validate playback

After recording, rerun playback without forcing record mode:

```bash
cd py
nox -s "test_openai_agents(latest)"
nox -s "test_litellm(latest)"
nox -s "test_langchain(latest)"
BRAINTRUST_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_RECORD_MODE=none nox -s "test_claude_agent_sdk(latest)"
```

If matrix versions changed in a way that could orphan cassette directories, also run:

```bash
cd py
make check-stale-cassettes
```

If the PR changed broader CI or workflow wiring, expand validation based on `.github/workflows/checks.yaml`.

## Report Back

Always report:

1. whether the PR was infra-only or needed targeted refresh work
2. which matrix keys or provider packages changed
3. which nox sessions you ran
4. which cassette directories or files you deleted and re-recorded
5. any suspicious diff items you investigated
6. whether you found and removed pollution
7. the final playback or validation result
