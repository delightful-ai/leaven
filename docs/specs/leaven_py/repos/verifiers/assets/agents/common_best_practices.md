## Shared Best Practices (All Contexts)

These points are direct restatements of Verifiers docs so agents can follow the same golden-path workflows.

- Environments are expected to expose `load_environment(...) -> vf.Environment` and be installable with `prime env install <env-name>`. (See `docs/overview.md` and `docs/environments.md`.)
- Validate environment behavior with `prime eval run <env-name> ...` before sharing/publishing changes. Treat `prime eval run` as the canonical eval path: it saves results automatically, and agents should not add opt-out flags such as `--skip-upload` unless the user explicitly requests that deviation so runs stay visible in the private Evaluations tab and in `prime eval view`. (See `docs/overview.md` and `docs/development.md`.)
- Agents should assume they are allowed to make live model calls through the user's authenticated Prime CLI when a live smoke test is useful. For Prime Inference models, use `prime eval run <env-name>` with the base eval configuration from the environment's `pyproject.toml`; do not edit that `pyproject.toml`, and do not add model/config flags unless the task truly requires them. Agents do not need to manage API keys. If sandboxing blocks outbound requests, request elevated permissions for `prime eval run`, preferably as an ongoing approval instead of per run.
- For new taskset/harness environments, use the v1 `vf.Env` / `vf.Taskset` / `vf.Harness` format. The golden shape is `load_taskset(config: MyTasksetConfig)` and optional `load_harness(config: MyHarnessConfig)` defining child config types, plus strict `load_environment(config: vf.EnvConfig)` asserting those child types and returning `vf.Env(taskset=load_taskset(taskset_config), harness=load_harness(harness_config))` or omitting `harness=` for the base harness. Do not accept `None`, synthesize fallback configs, or subclass `EnvConfig` just to narrow child config types. Treat [BYO Harness](docs/byo-harness.md) as the canonical authoring guide for reusable tasksets, reusable harnesses, framework programs, endpoint interception, and sandboxed Python/command programs.
- Use `ToolEnv`/`MCPEnv` for stateless tools and `StatefulToolEnv` when per-rollout state must persist (sandbox/session/db handles). (See `docs/environments.md`.)
- If external API keys are required, validate them in `load_environment()` with `vf.ensure_keys(...)` so failures are explicit and early. (See `docs/environments.md`.)

## Style Rules

Use these rules when shaping user-facing Verifiers APIs, configs, and environment files.

- Prefer Verifiers-native interfaces over stdlib-pure plumbing in user code. A stdlib-pure expression that forces every environment to write path manipulation, import-resource handling, ad hoc discovery, or boilerplate constants is a style bug; put that logic behind a Verifiers abstraction instead.
- Keep user-facing APIs incredibly minimal and elegant. The best surface is usually golfy but intuitive: one obvious field, one obvious constructor, and no redundant knobs unless there is a concrete long-term reason.
- Use Pydantic config models wherever structured configuration is needed. Pydantic is always acceptable and preferred over loose dictionaries when it clarifies the contract.
- Prefer strict, narrow types. Use `object`, broad unions, or untyped mappings only at explicit framework boundaries where arbitrary user values are genuinely part of the contract.
- Basic environments should fit in a few dozen self-contained, idiomatic lines: import `verifiers`, define typed taskset/harness config classes when needed, construct explicit taskset/harness objects in `load_environment`, and keep policy values in config subclasses. Use bindings for shared resources owned by tasksets, toolsets, users, programs, or harnesses; object entries should be loader specs, not pre-initialized resources.
- Avoid module globals. Acceptable globals are imports, immutable literals, factory functions, and carefully managed process-level resource constraints such as locks or semaphores. Put all other behavior and state in well-named utility modules, taskset/harness classes, toolsets, users, programs, or user code.
- Additional code should have a clear home. Do not hide utilities at the bottom of files or scatter one-off helpers through environment entrypoints.
